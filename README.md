## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nishad

### ðŸ‘€ About me:
Iâ€™m a fourth year Computer Engineering student at UCLA, and I have a strong interest in both hardware and software. I'm particularly interested in ...
- Computer Architecture & Digital Design
- Embedded Systems & State Estimation
- Satellites & Other Space Systems


### ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on ...
- **RISC-V CPU Simulation:** Expanding my custom RISC-V CPU simulator to support the full RV32I base ISA, with configurable cache and branch prediction schemes. The CLI-based tool tracks all register values at any instruction or cycle, with plans for future GUI integration.
- **Wireless, RF, and Analog Project:** Building a 27â€¯MHz wireless data transmission system to send a stream of bits from one microcontroller to another. This involves analog/RF design, bitstream encoding, and low-level signal processing.
- **Robot SLAM Simulation:** Developing a SLAM system to simultaneously localize a robot and map its environment. This project combines elements of probabilistic robotics, control, and real-time simulation.


### ðŸ“« Let's Connect:
I'm always excited to meet people who share my interests.
